# Hazardous Object Classification

This repository contains code for classifying objects orbiting the Earth as hazardous or non-hazardous. The code uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the hazard status of the objects based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/some-link).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucifer19807/society_task_1
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the project directory.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook classification.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and train the SVM model.

4. Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score.

## Results

The trained SVM model provides predictions on the hazard status of objects orbiting the Earth. The model's performance can be assessed using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
